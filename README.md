This application takes in a country and medal type, and it makes a prediction for Paris Olympics 2024. The application utilizes a linear regression model based on previous years and medals earned by that country.

## Reason
I was curious about Machine Learning and how to apply it to any current day event. In July of 2024, Summer Olympics were starting and I wanted to see if I can make a model to predict a country's medals.

## How to Use
1. Start the application by clicking on the link
2. Select medal type
3. Select country
5. Click "Get Predictions"
6. Wait for "medals predicted" and voila!
